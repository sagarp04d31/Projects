         <h1>How Technology has affected me in my daily life?<br></h1>
               <p class="long-copy">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information technology is
                  concerned with improvements in a variety of human and organizational problem-solving endeavors, through the design, development and use of
                  technologically based systems and processes that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of information in a variety of strategic, tactical
                  and operational situations. Ideally, this is accomplished through critical attention to the
                  information needs of humans in problem-solving tasks and the provision of technological aids, including electronic communication and computer
                  -based systems of hardware and software and associated processes. Information technology complements
                   and enhances traditional engineering through emphasis on the information basis for engineering.Arguably, the one piece of technology that has been most effective in our lives today is cell phones which are today considered a show of civilization. Owing to the many changes taking place in the technological world, the dependency on technology is growing with each passing day. There are advancements that take place at a very fast rate to the point that at one point they turn out to be self-defeating. The ability to transform carbon dioxide to fuel energy is a great breakthrough and the moment it is well set up, it will forever change the way we depend on limited and non-renewable sources.</p>
<p class="long-copy"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the internet is growing at a very fast rate with each passing day. The internet literally links more than 700 million people from all corners of the world. This technology is without doubt state of the art and has served to greatly better the way we communicate and also the educational standards. Owing to this great innovation in technology, it is possible for a person to get information on any topic from anywhere at any time. It has made education easily available to each and every person. It has also made improvisations on so many ways we use to satisfy our needs and meet all expectations. It has provided us with much easier and faster ways to solve urgent problems.The great technological revolution has brought about online databases, personalized web pages, discussion rooms and chat rooms. The Information technology sector has fully transformed human communication with the likes of instant messaging, video conferencing and emails. Technology has helped people to construct bridges to reduce the distance in their head. One drawback that has come with all this is the changing of people into lethargic beings owing to the high technological trends. It has greatly reduced people’s ability to pay attention. Computerization, automation and robotics are on the move to transform our lives. Getting the robotics implemented will help us to get cheaper labor and higher efficiency which will result in more productivity.

                   Technology caught the world by storm and the advancements that are still being made with each passing day are without doubt hitting the world with a bang. Technology has definitely changed the way we live our lives in a big way making everything much easier and faster. It has turned the world into a global village and it is no longer necessary for one to physically be in a place to be able to communicate with someone or perform some other activity. So, we can say that technology has greatly impacted our lives.</p>
          <p class="long-copy"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is very powerful and nothing is as good as technology at improving life. Even though this is both good on paper and on the surface there are drawbacks to this. Technology can affect life both positively and negatively. New technology always changes our life very much and takes it to a new level. It is like the new way of thinking or doing the normal things differently, better and much more faster with less hassle and at a much affordable rate. Imagine life before Electricity, Life before the Automobile, life before the Telephone, life before the Computer, life before the iPhone. Before those technologies life was much less complex but it was at the same time very difficult to get many things done with just the twelve hours of visible light that we are given with each day.
